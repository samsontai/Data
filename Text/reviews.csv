0,"___ ! ? ; Hands, down!;. the best robot vacuum I have owned.  This robot cleans so efficiently, but the app needs a little work.  Even without the app, I am amazed at its performance. Setup was easy."
1,"It's; neat and stylish.  It's fully loaded with technology.  The marketing is cute.  However, they've launched a product with incomplete and unreliable features.  ...but I still like the little guy enough to not give up just yet."
2,I've: never had so much trouble with connecting something to Wi-Fi.   Whatever chipset is used for Wi-Fi communication is just odd and clunky.  I've not been able to properly and reliably connect the device to any form of secured network.
3,"It also seems to not beep when it gets stuck somewhere. It has a little ear piercing beeper, and well when it got stuck it just turned off and the error light illuminated.  "
4,"I am horribly regretting this purchase. A) Recon got finished, the app crashed and the map was lost. [Vacuuming can't complete.] B) Re-run recon with app closed, and it didn't save. [Vacuuming can't complete.] C) Re-run of recon, midway the app crashed and the robot stopped acting...lost the map. D) Re-ran the recon...it finished with the app not crashing. Started clean, it started to vacuum, then it stopped...you guessed it!!!"
5,"I waited to leave a review for this robot until BrandX had a chance to fix their app which does NOT work on iOS. I've tried 3 different phones and none of them work. I have TWO of these robots and it's now clear to me why they discounted them 200 bucks. They updated their app last week and I gave it an immediate test. It does the SAME THING!!! I get it ‘connected’ by putting in my wifi password, and then it tries to ‘connect to server’ and then it sits there for a bit and then goes back to asking me for my wifi password. THE SAME THING IT DID before the app update! FRUSTRATING!!!!  While the vacuum robot works well and does what you want, 50% of the reason I bought it was because of the promised app features.  Save your money and buy something else IMO. BrandX is NOT willing to fix what's broken."
6,"This thing sucks, and not the way it's supposed to.  It never saves the map. I have to run recon mode every time I turn it on. Half the time it's battery dies before it returns home. All it does is bump into the walls and die."
7,"The vacuum by itself is probably great, but the app is unstable as of this writing. The map does not stay in memory and if there is no map in memory it won't do a scheduled cleaning. It's a huge bummer."
8,The bugginess with the app makes this product pretty much unusable.  It's been work around after work around to get it to work.  The commands don't work from the app and when I contact support all I get is ‘We are working on a firmware update that will fix this issue.’
9,"Let's start with the pros.  The vac seems to be high quality and the technology seems to be solid as well.  Setup was also fairly straight forward. When the robot is working well (more and this in the cons) it does a pretty good job at picking up pet hair and dust.  Now the cons.  The vac is rated with a 2 hour run time. I would understand a little under or over depending on floor conditions what power you run it on (stealth, normal, beast), etc. I am getting 1 hour run time on normal mode with a mix of tile and carpet.  Much under the advertised 2 hours."
10,"The robo vac  was extremely well marketed.  I feel sheepish to say that, like a sucker, I bought into it.  It charged up after a few hours. I then just manually ran it by pushing the play button on the robot. It ran around the house cleaning up and I was so giddy excited to watch it that I stayed up till 1:30am to watch this thing navigate my house and do a fairly decent job of it.  HOWEVER, the next day I realized that to access the majority of the functionality on this robot, you must use the app and connect the robot to your wireless network. Easy right!? because EVERYTHING now days can do this seamlessly.  WRONG!! this is where the vac loses 3 stars.  The wireless card on this robot was bad.  I blame the marketing team because they probably forced this product to market too quickly."
11,"Where do I begin? The app that others are complaining about? Yes it appears they finally got it working - at least the vacuum connected to my wifi with no issues. However, like other have mentioned, after running Recon mode and taking 20 minutes, the map wouldn't save."
12,I hooked it up to my Wi-Fi on the first try and also hooked it up to my Alexa. It hooked up and worked the very first time with no issues. I love you clean my house twice and it was perfect maps are easy to set up an easy to block. I have yet to have a problem with it docking perfectly.
13,"No it is not equal to one of those $900 robot vacs, but for $100 from Amazon Warehouse you can’t beat it. As luck has it, mine was delivered in new condition and had never been used. The only thing missing was the cleaning tool which is no big deal. Yes you do have to charge it for 2-3 hours before it will setup. Once it did charge it setup just fine with the new update BrandX Home app & updates the firmware. The BrandX Robot app to use with Google Home works too, but I found that I had to say ‘BrandX Robot’ then the few commands Google Home has for the Rogue 970. Most don’t mention but it does have 3 cleaning levels, Stealth, Normal, Beast. The Beast mode does use the battery faster but picks up more. So for the price-point I could not be happier, for $300 I’d probably go for the Shark Ion 750. But for $100 and not expecting $900 performance I am totally happy."
14,"The app seems to have some great features. However, the app takes forever to load, keeps saying it lost its connection, the map keeps failing to load, and it gets slower and slower the more it's used. I have to wipe the cache and it works a little better then hobbles again."
15,I spent nearly three full days to try to connect it to my 2.4GHZ network but to no avail.
16,"The Vacuum has a ton of features for the price, so when the app didn't work very well I stuck with the Vac because I it cleaned well and I figured they would get fix the app."
17,"I would love to give this five stars, because I loved it when it worked. It worked perfectly for the first few days, but then the problems started. It changed its name on the app and then it’s mission history disappeared."
18,"Could not get wifi or bluetooth to connect stayed on the phone with customer service for hours trying to assist in getting connection, finally after second customer service person who had me try on secured and unsecured wifi still did work advised me to return to wherever I bought it from."
19,I had read the poor reviews before purchasing. I thought only needing it for one large rectangle shaped classroom could help make this be a better experience for me than someone who was trying to do an entire house. This was not the case. The app did not work on IOS my son has an android so he helped set it up. I scheduled cleaning times blocked out the hallway access on the app. The schedule cleanings happened but the robot only cleaned half of my classroom. The Alexa skills wouldn't work either. Even though I blocked access to the school hallway through the app on my sons phone the bot would escape anyway and go on an elementary school adventure! I would often find the bot sitting in the middle of the floor. I was so disappointed and I had my first Amazon return EVER. I have sense purchased another brand and it is working perfectly for my classroom. I was truly disappointed with this product and I went in this deal knowing it was not going to be perfect... it was just much worse than what I thought it was going to be.
20,"The absolute worst purchase I’ve made this year. When it actually works, which is rare, it doesn’t finish the job. I’ll come home from work some days and it’ll be sitting in the middle of the floor with battery left. It actually got stuck in the exact same spot FOUR days in a row. I’d love to put a wall around that spot, but the app has never worked for me."
21,"The program is very stupid, it worked once, then the map was lost, it need to recon again, but it didn’t finish recon and went directly home although the battery was fully charged. Very disappointed, will return the product."
